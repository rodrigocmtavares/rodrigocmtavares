# Hi there 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  

I’m Rodrigo, an experienced IT professional and software developer always willing to explore new technologies and sharpen my skills. While almost all of the code I current work with is housed in a private Gitea instance as part of my professional role at SageData Solutions, I use this space for experimentation, learning, and sharing.  

### What You'll Find Here ❓
🔍 **Experimentation:** Repositories featuring training exercises, personal experiments, and beginner-level projects as I explore tools and technologies like Java, Spring Boot, C#, React, NextJS, Express, Angular, Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, Python, etc.  

🚀 **Future Plans:** I aim to grow my open-source contributions, share more polished projects, and collaborate with the wider developer community.

### My Interests (a sample) 💭
- **Cross-platform development 📱🖥️:** Mobile (native Android with Java and Kotlin, Flutter), Desktop (Java Swing & JavaFX, native Windows)
- **Web and new technologies 🕸️:** Experimenting with Full-Stack and new(ish) languages like Go and Rust
- **DevOps Practices 🚧:** Building efficient workflows with tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Terraform.  
- **Security and Cryptography 🪪:** Exploring best practices for protecting machine identities and secure software development.  
- **Learning & Growth 🔭🌱:** Constantly improving my knowledge of multiple areas like: containerization, SaaS, CI/CD, etc.
